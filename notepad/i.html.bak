<h1> Why start with the piano?</h1>

<p> You may be questioning why consider starting with a piano, when there are many</p>
<p> other instruments to choose from. The main reason for this is because learning</p>
<p> the piano enables you to gain valuable transferrable skills that can be used </p>
<p> for playing nearly any other instrument. The piano is considered to be a sort of </p>
<p> foundation of sorts within the music industry. </p>

<h1> Buying the right piano </h1>

<p> When looking to buy your piano, there are many factors to be considered. It isn't </p>
<p> simply about the appearance and cost, but the feel of it. Choose one that you </p>
<p> feel comfortable using, such as feeling for how hard it is to press down a note</p>
<p>and whether pressing it with more force makes a difference in the volume.</p>

<h1> Technique</h1>

<p> Playing the piano correctly isn't simply just reading off the sheet music, things </p>
<p> such as your posture and your expressions are also important. It is necessary to </p>
<p> adopt a good seating posture as doing it wrong can lead to back pains and irritation</p>
<p> to your shoulder and neck.An improper hand technique also will have negative affects </p>
<p> in the long term, so it would be best if the correct practices are implemented. </p>
