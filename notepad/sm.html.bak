<h1> Learning piano keys </h1>

<p> To start off, we look at what the piano looks like. You will observe that there </p>
<p> are black keys in groups of two's and three's, making it easier to know the name of</p>
<p> a key. Throughout the piano, spot any two sets of black keys and see the white key on</p>
<p> the left. This is called the 'C' note. After C comes D, then E all the way to G</p>
<p> after which A and B follows. After B, it starts again at the C note(which is on </p>
<p> the left of the two black keys again). This pattern continues to repeat until the </p>
<p> last key.</p>

<h1> Middle C </h1>

<p> Find the C note in the middle of the piano. As mentioned before, look at the</p>
<p> two black keys and see the white note to the left to get a C note, but this time</p>
<p> instead of a C note on some random part of the piano, ensure that it is in the middle.</p>

<h1> Reading Sheet music </h1>

<p>This image shows how sheet music is to be played. If you found the Middle C earlier, </p>
<p> the note labelled 'Middle C' is to be played with the thumb of the right hand. </p>
<p> Your index finger should play the second note, which is the D note all the way to </p>
<p> the pinky finger, which is the G note.</p>
