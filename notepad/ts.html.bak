<h1>The left hand </h1>

<p> In this image, it is demonstrated how the left hand can be used to play the middle</p>
<p> C note. It is to be done with the thumb strictly for now. Another new concept seen</p>
<p> here are the two symbols on the left which looks like an 'and' and a 'comma' sign. </p>
<p> The symbol that resembles the and sign is called a treble clef and is meant to signify</p>
<p> that anything that is played on those five lines must be on the right hand and the </p>
<p>sybol that resembles a comma is called a bass clef and the five lines containing the </p>
<p> bass clef is to be played with the left hand.</p>

<p>This second image demonstrates both left and right hand side. As the right hand </p>
<p> progresses upwards, the left hand (bass clef) moves backwards. </p>

<h1>Flats and sharps</h1>

because F and B do not have a black key on their right" width="350" height="200">

<p> In the first image, some notes appear to have what looks like a hashtag next to them.</p>
<p>This hashtag is what's known as a sharp, which means for instance, if we look at </p>
<p> C# this would mean that the black note on the right of the C key is to be played.</p>
<p>The same principle is applied for D# F# G# and A# which is that the black key on the right</p>
<p> of these notes is to be played.</p>

<p> Just like the sharp concept, we have flats ♭ which, instead of being the black key to the </p>
<p>right is the black key to the left. Notice again how there is no C♭ or F♭ as there is no</p>
<p> black key to the left of C and F.</p>
