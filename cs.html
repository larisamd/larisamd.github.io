<h1> Chords </h1>

<p> Chords are the building blocks of music.They can be found through various genres of music</p>
<p> and being aware of how they work will help improve both for theory and in practice.</p>
<p>Chords are simply playing multiple notes at once, so more than one key is pushed at the same time.</p>
<p>There are nine types, but only one type will be mentioned here, called major chords. Major chords </p>
<p> are known for sounding "bright" and "happy" as opposed to minor chords that are known to sound </p>
<p>"gloomy" and "sad". Chords are determined by scales, which is written about below. However, </p>
<p> it will not be mentioned here how chords are derived from scales, but only show the major chords 
and their notes.</p>

<p>Scales are a collection of related notes. They are played one note at a time in the order </p>
<p> given in the table below. Like chords, they are one of </p>
<p> the significant building blocks of music, which builds melodies and harmonies.Chords are </p>
<p> derived from scales. Again, just like chords, there are many types of scales, but the major </p>
<p>scales will only be mentioned on the table below.</p>
